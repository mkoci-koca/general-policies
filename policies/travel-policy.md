    and the required travel arrangement time period.
-   Travellers are not allowed to authorize their own travel
    arrangements.
-   Any ad-hoc variations to The Policy must be authorised by the OMC.

Only the OMC can appoint Travel Approvers and amend the ***Travel
Approver Table***.

Travel Time
-----------

Travel Time is the time spent travelling for OpenSSL business purposes
that is outside of normal to/from work travel.

Travel Time payments only apply to those persons paid by OpenSSL (i.e.
contractors).

This should be done via the contractor's normal monthly invoice and
should not be claimed on the **Expenses Reimbursement Form**.

Travel Time should be listed separately from the contractor's normal
working hours on their monthly invoice, so that it does not count in
their maximum working hours for the month/year.

Normal working hours and rates apply for time spent away from home where
contractor is not travelling e.g. attending a conference or work
meeting.

OpenSSL will pay Travel Time in line with the contractor's normal hourly
rate up to a maximum of 7.5 hours per 24 hour period of travel.

*Example 1*:

Contractor travels overseas and is in transit a total of 26 hours, they
would claim 7.5 hours for the first 24 hours and then an additional 2
hours in the second 24 hour period, total Travel Time claim would be 9.5
hours.

*Example 2*:

Contractor travels overseas and is in transit a total of 10 hours, they
would claim 7.5 hours for the first 24 hour period.

The contractor then attends the conference the next day and works from 9
am to 12 pm (with applicable breaks) they would bill 3 hours for this
period.

Contractor returns home and is in transit a total of 10.5 hours, they
would claim 7.5 hours for the second 24 hour period.

The Total that the contractor can charge is 15 hours Travel Time + 3
hours normal work x (*contractor's hourly rate*).

*Example 3*:

Contractor travels interstate and is in transit a total of 4 hours, they
would claim 4 hours in the first 24 hour period.

The contractor then attends the conference and works from 10 am to 3pm
(with applicable breaks) they would bill 5 hours for this period.

Contractor then returns home and is in transit a total of 4.5 hours,
they would claim another 3.5 hours Travel Time as they are still within
the original 24 hour period.

The Total that the contractor can charge is 7.5 hours Travel Time + 5
hours normal work x (*contractor's hourly rate*).
