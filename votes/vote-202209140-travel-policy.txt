Topic: Accept the travel policy as at commit f9f4922
Proposed by: Pauli
Issue link: https://github.com/openssl/general-policies/pull/26
comment: We need something in place quickly so flight planning for the
         upcoming face to face can be done.  There is an intention to
         consider the existing feedback and update the policy in the
         near future.
